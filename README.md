The kernel driver Intel® Data Accelerator Driver (IDXD)  is a typical kernel driver that identifies devices instances in a system. This is also a component referred to in the Intel® Scalable IOV specification as the Virtual Device Composition Module (VDCM) that creates instances to facilitate exposing a virtual Intel® DSA instance to a guest OS.

accel-config is a utility that allows system administrators to configure groups, workqueues and engines. The utility parses the topology and capabilities exposed via sysfs and provides a command line interface to configure resources.
