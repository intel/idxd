Load and scan through the pre-defined configuration file in json format,
and set the configured attribute into corresponding component.

There is a sample config file at
/etc/accel-config/accel-config.conf.sample, and it can be used as a
reference for user about how the loadable config file looks like, but it
should not be used directly given the variance of each system. The user
should create a proper config file according to the format of sample
file and use "-c" option to point to the config file.
