    <p> The kernel driver Intel速 Data Accelerator Driver (IDXD) is a typical kernel driver 
      that identifies devices instances in a system. This is also a component referred to in 
      the Intel速 Scalable IOV specification as the Virtual Device Composition Module (VDCM) that 
      creates instances to facilitate exposing a virtual Intel速 DSA instance to a guest OS.
